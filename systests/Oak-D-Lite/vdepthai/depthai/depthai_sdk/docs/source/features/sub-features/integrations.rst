SDK provides a simple integration with `Roboflow <https://blog.roboflow.com/deploy-roboflow-model-luxonis-depth-sdk/>`__ that allows you to run a custom trained AI
model on an OAK camera. Example is also available `on Github <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/main/depthai_sdk/examples/NNComponent/roboflow_integration.py>`__.
