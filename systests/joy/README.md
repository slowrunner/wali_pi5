=== Instruction manual for 2.4 GHz Wireless USB Controller ===  

Please read before use:  
1. Make sure the controller is fully charged prior to first use to ensure battery is at maximum capacity.  
2. Make sure to use a standard 5v 1A charger to avoid damage to the controller.  
3. Do not charge the controller for over 2 hours.  
4. The red LED will flash rapidly during normal use indicating that the controller is low on battery.  
   Please charge the controller immediately to avoid losing connection.  
5. The red LED will blink slowly when the controller is charging, it will disappear once the   
   controller is fully charged and ready for use.  
6. When the controller and the receiver cannot be connected successfully,  
   press the DOWN+SELECT+START buttons at the same time, and the red LED  
   of the controller flashes to reset.  They can be paired successfully.  


Pairing the controller:  
1. Turn on the controller by pressing the START button, the red LED will blink slowly  
2. Press the START button again, the red LED will flash rapidly indicating the controller  
   is ready to pair.  
3. Plug in the USB receiver to the PC, the red LED will stay lit  
   to indicate the controller has been paired successfully.  


LED Functions:  
1.  Press START button, LED flashes slowly: controller is "On"  
2.  With controller on, press START again, and LED flashes quickly: searching for adapter  
3.  LED on continuously:  connected/paired successfully  
4.  During charging, LED flashing every 2 seconds: charging - LED turns off when fully charged  
5.  LED flashes quickly intermittently:  battery low
